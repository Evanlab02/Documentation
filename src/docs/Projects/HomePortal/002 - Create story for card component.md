- [Issue](https://github.com/Evanlab02/HomePortal/issues/16)
- [Branch](https://github.com/Evanlab02/HomePortal/tree/16-create-story-for-card-component)
- [PR](https://github.com/Evanlab02/HomePortal/pull/17)
## Description

Currently we are missing some stories for some components from the home portal component library, we will be focusing on the the card component.

We should add a story for the card component.
### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1 - Create story (stories) for the card component in the Home Portal component library.
- BONUS - Update compose file with latest versions and update documentation with latest versions
## Outcome
### Added a story for the card component

Within the home portal component library, we have a card component that does not have any existing storybook stories to view it. So we have added that to the storybook now.
### Support 0.17.0 of the Shopping List App

Home Portal now officially supports 0.17.0 of the Shopping List App. This has now become the recommended version for running instances of Home Portal and the documentation has been updated to reflect that.
### Upgraded versions to 0.3.2 in compose file

For the upcoming release of 0.3.2, I have decided to update compose files in anticipation for that as this will also ensure the installer is using the latest versions, instead of 0.2.0.
