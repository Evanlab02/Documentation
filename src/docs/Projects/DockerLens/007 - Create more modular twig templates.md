- PR (Pending)

## Description

Create more modular twig templates that will allow only loading the necessary CSS and JS files instead of loading all.  
This will also remove the need to have HTML within the index.php file.

### Acceptance criteria

AC1 - Create base template that loads all base resources.  
AC1.1 - Allow for injecting styles that will be required for each page.  
AC1.2 - Allow for injecting JS that will be required for each page.  
AC2 - Any other improvements to the twig templates.

## Outcome
