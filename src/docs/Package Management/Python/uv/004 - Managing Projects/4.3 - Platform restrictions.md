# Platform restrictions

## Limited resolution environments

If your project supports a more limited set of platforms or Python versions, you can constrain the set of solved platforms via the `environments` setting, which accepts a list of PEP 508 environment markers. For example, to constrain the lockfile to macOS and Linux, and exclude Windows:

```toml
[tool.uv]
environments = [
    "sys_platform == 'darwin'",
    "sys_platform == 'linux'",
]
```

Entries in the `environments` setting must be disjoint (i.e., they must not overlap). For example, `sys_platform == 'darwin'` and `sys_platform == 'linux'` are disjoint, but `sys_platform == 'darwin'` and `python_version >= '3.9'` are not, since both could be true at the same time.
## Platform-specific dependencies

To ensure that a dependency is only installed on a specific platform or on specific Python versions, use Python's standardized environment markers syntax.

For example, to install jax on Linux, but not on Windows or macOS:

```bash
uv add 'jax; sys_platform == "linux"'
```

or for python versions:

```bash
uv add 'numpy; python_version >= "3.11"'
```
